# Operating System
### **What is an Operating System (OS)?**  

An **Operating System (OS)** is a special software that helps a computer work properly. It acts as a **bridge** between the computer's **hardware** (CPU, RAM, hard disk, etc.) and the **user** (you).  

### **Example to Understand Easily**  
Think of a restaurant.  
- The **kitchen** (hardware) cooks food.  
- The **customer** (user) wants to eat food.  
- But the customer doesn’t talk directly to the kitchen. Instead, a **waiter** (OS) takes the order and brings the food.  

Just like the waiter helps the kitchen and customer communicate, an **OS helps the user and hardware work together smoothly.**  

### **Main Functions of an OS**  
1. **Manages Hardware** – Controls CPU, memory, and storage.

📌 **System Call = Request to OS for a service**  
📌 **Acts as a bridge between programs & hardware**  
📌 **Ensures security by limiting direct hardware access**  
📌 **Used for process, file, device, and communication management**  

💡 **Think of a System Call as a 'Service Request' sent to the OS whenever a program needs help!** 🚀

# **Process in OS - Easy & Rememberable**  

- **Process = Program in Execution**  
  - A program (C/C++/Python, etc.) is just a file until it runs.  
  - When executed, it becomes an **active process**.  

- **Example:**  
  - Writing a C program → Compiling it → Creates a binary file (program).  
  - Running the binary → Turns into a **process**.  

- **Key Points:**  
  - **Program = Passive (just code).**  
  - **Process = Active (running instance).**  
  - One program can create **multiple processes** (e.g., opening a browser multiple times creates multiple processes).  


### **Memory Layout of a Process - Easy & Rememberable** 

![alt text](images/12_psm.png)

A process in memory has **4 main sections**:  


1. **Text (Code) Section** 📜  
   - Stores executable instructions (read-only).  
   - Example: The actual C/C++/Python code being executed.  

2. **Stack** 📌  
   - Holds temporary data like **function parameters, return addresses, and local variables**.  
   - Grows and shrinks as functions are called and return.  

3. **Data Section** 📊  
   - Stores **global variables**.  
   - Example: `int x = 10;` (declared outside functions).  

4. **Heap** 🏗️  
   - Stores **dynamically allocated memory** (e.g., `malloc()` in C, `new` in C++).  
   - Grows as needed during program execution.

(T = Text, S = Stack, D = Data, H = Heap) ✅


### **Process Lifecycle - Easy & Rememberable**  

A process goes through different **phases** (states) during its lifecycle.

![alt text](images/13_state_diagram.png)

 Here’s the **5-state process model** in simple terms:

1. **New** 🆕  
   - The process is just **created**. It hasn't started running yet, but its **Process Control Block (PCB)** has been created to store info about the process.

2. **Ready** ⏳  
   - The process is **ready to run**, waiting for the **CPU** to be free. It’s like waiting in line to get a turn.

3. **Running** 🏃‍♂️  
   - The process is **actively running** on the CPU. Only **one process** can be in this state at a time.

4. **Blocked/Waiting** 💤  
   - The process cannot run right now. It is **waiting for something** to happen, like finishing an I/O operation (e.g., reading from disk).

5. **Exit/Terminate** 🛑  
   - The process has **finished** or has been **stopped**. It’s **removed from memory** and released by the operating system.

🔥 **Quick Trick to Remember:** **N R R B E** → **"New Ready Running, Blocked Exit"**  
(Just remember the first letters of each state!) ✅

### **Process Control Block (PCB) - Easy & Rememberable**  

A **Process Control Block (PCB)** is like the **identity card** of a process. It helps the **Operating System (OS)** track and manage processes.

Here’s what it stores:

1. **Process Status** 🟢🛑:  
   - The **current state** of the process (Ready, Running, Blocked, etc.).

2. **Program Counter (PC)** ⏯️:  
   - The address of the next instruction the process will execute.

3. **Memory Usage** 🧠:  
   - Details about the memory the process is using.

4. **Open Files** 📂:  
   - Information about files that the process has opened.

5. **CPU Scheduling Info** 🖥️:  
   - Information about how the process will be scheduled to run on the CPU.

### **How It Works:**
- **Creation**: When a process is created, its **PCB** is created too. It’s like a guide for the OS on how to manage the process.
- **Process Table** 📋:  
   - The **Process Table** is an **array** of all PCBs in the system. It tracks every process currently running.

### **Quick Trick to Remember**:  
**S-P-M-O-C** → **"Status, PC, Memory, Open Files, CPU"**

Just remember the order of what the PCB tracks! ✅



### **Structure of Process Control Block (PCB) - Easy & Rememberable**

![alt text](images/15_pcb_main.png)

A **Process Control Block (PCB)** is like a **record book** 📖 that stores everything about a process. The OS uses it to manage and control processes efficiently.  

### **Main Components of a PCB** 🏗️  

1. **Process State** 🔄  
   - Shows if the process is **Running, Ready, Waiting, or Terminated**.  

2. **Process ID (PID)** 🆔  
   - A **unique number** given to every process by the OS.  

3. **Program Counter (PC)** ⏯️  
   - Stores the address of the **next instruction** to be executed (useful during context switching).  

4. **CPU Registers** 🎯  
   - Stores important data like **accumulators, index registers, stack pointers**, etc.  

5. **CPU Scheduling Info** 🖥️  
   - Stores priority levels and scheduling **algorithms** to decide which process runs next.  

6. **Memory Management Info** 🧠  
   - Keeps track of **base & limit registers, page tables, or segment tables** for memory access.  

7. **Accounting Info** 📊  
   - Tracks **CPU time used, time limits, job/process numbers, and resource usage**.  

8. **I/O Status Info** 🎧  
   - Stores **allocated I/O devices** (printers, hard disks) and open files list.  

9. **List of Open Files** 📂  
   - Contains all files that the process has opened.
