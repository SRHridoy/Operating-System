# Operating System
### **What is an Operating System (OS)?**  

An **Operating System (OS)** is a special software that helps a computer work properly. It acts as a **bridge** between the computer's **hardware** (CPU, RAM, hard disk, etc.) and the **user** (you).  

### **Example to Understand Easily**  
Think of a restaurant.  
- The **kitchen** (hardware) cooks food.  
- The **customer** (user) wants to eat food.  
- But the customer doesn’t talk directly to the kitchen. Instead, a **waiter** (OS) takes the order and brings the food.  

Just like the waiter helps the kitchen and customer communicate, an **OS helps the user and hardware work together smoothly.**  

### **Main Functions of an OS**  
1. **Manages Hardware** – Controls CPU, memory, and storage.  
2. **Runs Programs** – Helps apps and software work properly.  
3. **File Management** – It allocates and de-allocates the resources and also decides who gets the resource. 
4. **Device Control** – Handles keyboard, mouse, printer, etc.  
5. **User Interface** – Gives a way to interact (like Windows screen or Linux terminal).  
6. **Memory Management** – Allocates and manages the computer's memory.  
7. **Process Management** – It allocates the processor to a process and then de-allocates the processor when it is no longer required or the job is done. 
8. **Input-Output Management** – Manages input and output operations.  
9. **Error Handling** – Detects and handles errors.  
10. **Parallel Processing** – Manages the execution of multiple processes simultaneously.  
11. **Security Management** – Protects the system from unauthorized access.  
12. **Role - Government** – Ensures the system operates efficiently and enforces policies.

### **In Short:**  
An **Operating System** is the **brain of a computer** that helps everything work together so that we can use the computer easily! 🚀  

### **Components of an Operating System**  

An **Operating System (OS)** has two main components:  

1. **Shell**  
   - The **outermost layer** of the OS.  
   - Handles interaction between the **user** and the **OS**.  
   - Takes **commands** from the user, processes them, and gives **output**.  
   - Example: **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** or **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

2. **Kernel**  
   - The **core part** of the OS.  
   - Directly interacts with **hardware** like CPU, memory, and devices.  
   - Manages **system calls, memory, and applications**.  

#### **Functions of Kernel:**  
- **System Call Control** – Manages communication between software and hardware.  
- **I/O Management** – Controls input/output operations.  
- **Process & Memory Management** – Handles running programs and memory allocation.  

#### **Types of Kernel:**  
- **Monolithic Kernel** – Large and includes all system services in one place.  
- **Microkernel** – Minimal, with only essential functions, and other services run separately.  
- **Hybrid Kernel** – Mix of monolithic and microkernel, used in modern OS like Windows.  
- **Exokernel** – Very lightweight and customizable, used in research-based systems.  

### **Difference Between 32-Bit and 64-Bit Operating Systems**

### **Booting Process**  

**Booting** is the process of starting up a computer and loading the operating system into the computer's main memory (RAM). It involves several steps:

1. **Power On** – When the computer is powered on, the CPU is activated.
2. **POST (Power-On Self Test)** – The system performs a self-diagnostic to check hardware components like RAM, disk drives, and keyboard.
3. **BIOS/UEFI Initialization** – The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) initializes hardware and locates the bootloader.
4. **Bootloader Execution** – The bootloader (e.g., GRUB, Windows Boot Manager) loads the operating system kernel into memory.
5. **Kernel Initialization** – The OS kernel initializes system processes and drivers.
6. **System Startup** – The OS completes the startup process, loading necessary services and user interface.

The booting process ensures that the computer hardware and software are properly initialized and ready for use. 🚀

### **Types of Booting**  

1. **Cold Booting (Hard Booting)**  
    - **Definition**: Starting a computer from a completely powered-off state.  
    - **Process**: Involves turning on the power button, running POST, and loading the OS.  
    - **Use Case**: Used when the computer is initially turned on or after a complete shutdown.

2. **Warm Booting (Soft Booting)**  
    - **Definition**: Restarting a computer without turning off the power.  
    - **Process**: Involves using the restart option in the OS, which bypasses the full POST.  
    - **Use Case**: Used to refresh the system, apply updates, or recover from minor issues without a full shutdown.

3. **Dual Booting**  
    - **Definition**: Configuring a computer to boot into one of two different operating systems.  
    - **Process**: Involves installing multiple OS on separate partitions and using a bootloader to select the desired OS at startup.  
    - **Use Case**: Used by users who need to run different operating systems on the same hardware.

### **Types of Operating Systems**  

Operating Systems can be categorized based on functionalities they provide. Here are some common types:
---
1. **Batch Operating System**

    - **No direct interaction**: The user doesn't interact directly with the computer.
    - **Operator's role**: An operator groups similar jobs together (with the same needs) into **batches**.
    - **Process in groups**: Jobs are executed in batches for efficient management.

### **What is a Job?**
A **job** is a set of instructions given to an OS to execute. It includes all activities needed to complete a task, which can range from small programs to large processes.

![alt text](images/02_batch_os.png)
**Advantages of Batch Operating System:**

1. **Multiple users** can use the system at the same time.
2. **Low idle time**: The system uses its resources effectively.
3. **Easy to manage**: Large tasks can be handled easily in batches.

**Disadvantages of Batch Operating System:**

1. **Inefficient CPU use**: When a process is waiting for I/O, the CPU remains idle.
2. **Delay if a job fails**: Other jobs must wait if one job fails.
3. **Slower response**: Since tasks are processed one by one, it increases the waiting time.

**Examples**: Payroll systems, bank statement processing.

2. **Multi-Programming Operating System:**

    - **Multiple programs in memory**: Several programs are loaded into memory.
    - **One runs at a time**: The OS runs one program while others wait.
    - **Better resource usage**: Maximizes CPU and memory use.
    - **Improved efficiency**: Helps the system perform better by reducing idle time.

3. **Multi-Tasking/Time-sharing Operating Systems:**

- **Type of Multiprogramming**: Multiple tasks are running at the same time.
- **Round-robin execution**: Each task gets a fixed amount of time (called "quantum") to execute.
- **Fair CPU sharing**: Every user gets CPU time on a single system.
- **Task switching**: After the time is up, the OS switches to the next task.
- **Multitasking**: Can handle tasks from one or many users. 

**Key to remember:** Tasks run in turns, with each task getting equal time to execute.
